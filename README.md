## Known Game Fixes

This repo keeps track of known fixes for games running with Heroic Games Launcher.

Note that this information applies to using up to date versions of the different tools. Make sure to use the latest version of Heroic and Wine-GE-Proton or Proton-GE-Proton if on Linux. Fixes may work on Mac too depending on which compatibility layer is used if it supports Winetricks.

Keep in mind that some games may need extra fixes and not only the ones automated here, and that information is not yet mapped/supported.

Also note that some of these fixes may be redundant when using UMU on linux, since it also installs known fixes with protofixes.

## Collaborations

1. Add a JSON file following the file name convention with the game title, the list of fixes, the list of files to install, and notes as the content in the corresponding store folder.
2. Update this README adding the title of the game to the Store's list in alphabetical order

### Filename

`<appName>-<store>.json` where appName is the appName used by Heroic and store is one of `epic`, `gog`, or `amazon`

### JSON content

```json
{
  "title": "Empire Earth 3",
  "notes": {
    "physx": "Fix game crashing while booting",
    "d3dx9_30": "Fix crash opening the setting and visual glitches in game"
  },
  "winetricks": ["physx", "d3dx9_30"]
}
```

```json
{
  "title": "Fall Guys",
  "notes": {
    "vcrun2022": "Game prompts to install it, but we can prevent the need of user interaction.",
    "EpicOnlineServices/EpicOnlineServicesInstaller.exe": "Solves 'Missing Files' error. This is required but not listed as a pre-requisite"
  },
  "winetricks": ["vcrun2022"],
  "runInPrefix": ["EpicOnlineServices/EpicOnlineServicesInstaller.exe"]
}
```

The value of the `winetricks` property is an array of the names that Winetricks understands.

The value of the `runInPrefix` property is an array of strings with the paths of executables to install in the prefix, relative to the game's install folder.

The value of the `envVariables` property is an object with env variable names as the keys and env variables values as the values.

All properties are optional, but at least one of above should be defined for a file to be useful.

Optional (but encouraged) `"notes"` property can be used to add notes about what each Winetricks package is fixing. This is useful so in the future we can check if a package is still needed. We could eventually show that information to the user inside Heroic for transparency of what we are installing and why.

### Removals

When a fix is not needed anymore, remove the json file and strike-through the title in the Readme with a mention of why it's removed if the reason is known.
